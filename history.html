                    Brae, a well-preserved village dating back over 5,000 years. This era is characterized by advanced
                    stone construction and significant communal structures, such as the Ring of Brodgar and Maeshowe.

                <p>The Norse period began in the early 9th century when Vikings from Norway settled in Orkney. This era
                    saw the islands become a strategic base for Viking expeditions and trade, leaving a lasting impact
                    on local culture and place names.

                <p>Orkney played a pivotal role in both World Wars, particularly through its strategic naval base at
                    Scapa Flow. During World War I, Scapa Flow was the main base for the British Grand Fleet, and in
                    World War II, it was fortified with the Churchill Barriers to protect against enemy submarines.
